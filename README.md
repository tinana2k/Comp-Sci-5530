**Introduction:** One of the most basic forms of self-expression is speech, which encompasses a wide range of feelings, including excitement, peacefulness, joy, and rage, to mention a few. It is feasible to rearrange our activities, services, and even products in order to provide a more tailored experience to individual customers by evaluating the emotions that underlie communication.

**Task:** Create a classifier to recognize and extract emotions from different human voice sound files.
